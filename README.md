# MADRL-Cooperation

<p align=justify>This is the final project from Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree, which challenges us to develop DRL methods for situations where multiple agents have to interact with each other, either cooperatively or adversarially. This adds magnitudes of difficulty, as the agents need to find ways to communicate with each other. Additionally, the non-stationarity of the environment due to multiple agents training and behaving independently and stochastically breaks the Markov Property where the probability of the agent's future states depends solely on its current state. Finally, policy gradients methos suffer from increased variance and instability of training if they ignore the other agents' actions in their own optimization processes.</p>

<p align=justify>For this project I have implemented and successfully completed training of a multi-agent variant of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (<b>MADDPG</b>) and implemented an attention-based actor critic algorithm that is currently being tested for improvements and hyperparameter selection in the cooperative Tennis environment. I expect to complete training for the latter shortly, test both algorithms for the adversarial soccer environment and run a comparative study of both algorithms for both types of MADRL environments that I would add to this README.md in research paper format.</p>

<p align=justify>This work is based on the lectures and exercises from Udacity's DRL Nanodegree, extensive research on the DRL and MADRL literature, with special significance of the papers 'Multi-Agent Actor-Critic for Mixed Cooperative-Competitive Environments' (arXiv:1706.02275), 'Multi-focus Attention Network for Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning' (arXiv:1712.04603) and 'Actor-Attention-Critic for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning' (arXiv:1810.02912).</p>

## Tennis Cooperative Environment

<p align=justify>In this environment, two agents control rackets to bounce a ball over a net. If an agent hits the ball over the net, it receives a reward of +0.1. If an agent lets a ball hit the ground or hits the ball out of bounds, it receives a reward of -0.01. Thus, the goal of each agent is to keep the ball in play.</p>

<p align=justify>The observation space consists of 8 variables corresponding to the position and velocity of the ball and racket. Each agent receives its own, local observation. Two continuous actions are available, corresponding to movement toward (or away from) the net, and jumping.</p>

<p align=justify>The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agents must get an average score of +0.5 (over 100 consecutive episodes, after taking the maximum over both agents). Specifically,</p>

<p align=justify> • After each episode, we add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting), to get a score for each agent. This yields 2 (potentially different) scores.</p>
<p align=justify> • We then take the maximum of these 2 scores. This yields a single score for each episode.</p>

<p align=justify>The task is solved, when the average (over 100 episodes) of those scores is at least +0.5.</p>

## Running the models

<p align=justify> To run the different models available in this repository one only needs to clone/download from this repository the appropiate files from the folder of the model he/she wants to run and write in the command line: </p>

    $ python main.py
or

    $ python3 main.py
    
<p align=justify> which will start training the model from scratch until it reaches the environment's goal.</p>

<p align=justify>For example:
<p align=justify>1. Clone this repository.</p>
<p align=justify>2. Install all required dependencies.</p>
<p align=justify>3. And run the the command:</p>
     
    $ python3 path_to_MADDPG_folder/main.py --cuda=True
